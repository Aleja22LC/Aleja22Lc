## 👩🏻‍ God Day! 
### I am Lina Alejandra León 

I´m Front-End Developer with Business Administration studies focused on Project Management. 
I have been working on developing my leadership, mediation, and conflict resolution skills. 
I love programming as it presents itself as a combination of two things I greatly enjoy: technology and tasks where 
I can design and create new content.
